# Retake2_Business-project

I focused in this case and worked on it: 
Social Media Analytics for Business Strategy
Using social media data, create a tool that can discover trends and insights into brand percep-
tion, customer sentiment, and market trends. The discovered insights will be helpful for the
organization to align business strategy with data-driven feedback.

I creat and work with this file in C:\.  I built a GUI that can show graphs and data according to dataset.
The main file named "2" and The other two python files(Customer behavior.py and market trends.py) are called in the main python file.
The file's code contains a comment for each part.
